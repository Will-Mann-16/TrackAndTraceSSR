# TrackAndTraceSSR

This was an application I wrote during COVID times to use Track & Trace functionality for my hockey team to play in compliance with EH guidelines. The idea behind it was users would sign in and then say they are going to training or a fixture. It was powered by Next.js, Chakra UI, Prisma and Vercel.
